</p>
<h2>26. What is version control, and how is it used in web development?</h2>
<p> 
    Answer: Version control is a system that tracks changes made to code over time. Developers use version control systems like Git to collaborate on projects, ensure code integrity, and roll back to previous versions when necessary.
</p>
<h2>27. What is a website’s "bounce rate," and how can it be reduced?</h2>
<p> 
    
Answer: Bounce rate refers to the percentage of visitors who leave a website after viewing only one page. To reduce it, designers can improve website navigation, ensure fast load times, and provide engaging content that encourages users to explore further.
